**PIR SENSOR:** <br>
A passive infrared sensor is an electronic sensor that measures infrared light radiating from objects. PIR sensors mostly used in PIR-based motion detectors. Also, it used in security alarms and automatic lighting applications.Any object with temperature above zero kelvin is constantly radiating infrared rays to the outside world. The surface temperature of the human body is between 36° C - 27 ° C and most of its radiant energy concentrated in the wavelength range of 8 um-12 um.

The PIR sensor consists of three pins:<br>
Pin1 : Is connected to the positive supply 5V DC.<br>
Pin2 : Is the output pin of the sensor. The pin 2 of the sensor carries the detected IR signal to an amplifier.<br>
Pin3 : Is connected to the ground.

**WORKING OF PIR SENSOR:**<br>
Passive infrared alarms classified into infrared detectors (infrared probes) and alarm control sections. The most widely used infrared detector is a pyroelectric detector. It uses as a sensor for converting human infrared radiation into electricity.Fresnel lens used as a focusing system for infrared radiation.In the detection area, the lens of the detector receives the infrared radiation energy of the human body through the clothing and focused on the pyroelectric sensor. When the human body moves in this surveillance mode, it enters a certain field of view in sequence and then walks out of the field of view. The pyroelectric sensor sees the moving human body for a while and then does not see it, so the infrared radiation of human body constantly changes the temperature of the pyroelectric material. So that it outputs a corresponding signal, which is the alarm signal.

**COMPONENTS REQUIRED:**
1. PIR sensor
